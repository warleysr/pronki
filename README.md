# PronKi

PronKi is an Android app that allows you to practice your pronunciation using you Anki flashcards. It also has other features that can be helpful on your language learning journey!

## Pronunciation Assessment
Use your Anki flashcards to practice and improve your pronunciation by receiving a feedback for each word or phoneme. Supports multiple languages and accents and you can hear your pronunciation and the correct one for comparison.

## Import vocabulary through <mark>highlighted</mark> text
If you like to read physical books when learning a new language you probably mark some unknown words to add them to Anki later. With this app you can use a marker to highlight these words and import them into the app taking a picture.

Powered by OpenCV.

## Automatic flashcard creation with AI

You can configure the app to create flashcards automatically with your imported vocabulary using generative artificial intelligence.
