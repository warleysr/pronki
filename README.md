## Pronunciation Assessment
Use your Anki flashcards to practice and improve your pronunciation by receiving a feedback for each word or phoneme. Supports multiple languages and accents and you can hear your pronunciation and the correct one for comparison.

## Import vocabulary through <mark>highlighted</mark> text
If you like to read physical books when learning a new language you probably mark some unknown words to add them to Anki later. With this app you can use a marker to highlight these words and import them into the app taking a picture.

Powered by OpenCV. See [how to import vocabulary](https://github.com/warleysr/pronki/wiki/How-to-use-Vocabulary-Import) in Wiki.

## Automatic flashcard creation with AI

You can configure the app to create flashcards automatically with your imported vocabulary using generative artificial intelligence.
